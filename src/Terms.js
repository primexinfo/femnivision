            <h1><strong> CLIENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></h1>
            
             <br />
Please read these terms and conditions which apply to the provision of my professional services. By
making an appointment, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions. If you are unable or
unwilling to agree to these terms and conditions, then you should not book an appointment or continue
with your course of therapy.
<br />
<br />
<strong>FREE INITIAL CONSULTATION</strong>
<br />
You may be offered a free 20 minute online initial consultation. No therapy will be provided during the
consultation.
The purpose of this initial consultation is to X. During these calls, estimates of the number of sessions
required to deal with your presenting issue are given on the basis of the information presented at that
time. Estimates are only rough guidelines and are subject to change.
<br /> <br />
<strong>BOOKING &amp; PAYMENT</strong>
<br />
In-person sessions: A non-refundable deposit of £/$/€x is payable at the time of booking your first
in-person session. The balance of the fee is due at least 48 hours prior to the first session. No refunds
will be issued for cancellations within 48 hours of the session appointment.
Online sessions: No deposit is required for online sessions, however payment for online sessions must
be made at least 24 hours before the scheduled session start time. Where payment is not received
24 hours before your session, the session will be cancelled and may be offered to someone else. It
is your responsibility to pay the session fees before each scheduled session in order to confirm the
appointment booking.
<br />
<br />
<strong>CANCELLATION, RESCHEDULING &amp; REFUNDS</strong>

<br />
<br />
Cancellation &amp; rescheduling

If you need to cancel or re-schedule a session, please provide as much notice as possible. Notification
must be made via email or phone call at least 48 hours prior to an in-person session or 24 hours for an
online session.
<br />
Refunds
<br />
No refunds will be issued for cancellations within 48 hours of in-person sessions or 24 hours of online
sessions.
Session fees are for my time and professional expertise and are not a guarantee of a successful
outcome. Therefore, no refunds will be given for any sessions where you have attended and paid for
the session.
Where a discount package or therapy program has been booked and paid for in advance, if you choose
to discontinue your therapy process before attending all the sessions, a pro rata refund will be issued
after deduction of the full standard session fee for any sessions you have attended.
<br />
Session Fees
<br />
All professional fees will be disclosed to you prior to booking. My professional fees are subject to
review and may increase from time to time. You will always receive confirmation of the professional
fees before booking.
<br />
Payment Methods
Payment may be made online via credit/debit card or PAYPAL™. Payment for in-person sessions can
also be made via credit/debit card at the end of your session. Cash and cheques will not be accepted
without prior agreement.
<br />
<br />
<strong>CONTACT BETWEEN SESSIONS</strong>

<br />
Any contact between sessions will be by telephone, email or letter during office hours only (insert office
hours). Any messages received outside of these hours will be dealt with during office hours only.
<br />
<br />
<strong>MEDICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS</strong>

<br />
I may ask questions about your medical history to establish any contra-indications to treatment. This
will also help to assess whether your health is affecting (or being affected by) the therapeutic goals you
wish to achieve. Please update me of any medical changes during your course of therapy, or if you are
returning to therapy after a period of absence.
If you are receiving care or treatment from any medical, healthcare or therapy practitioner, e.g. GP,
Psychologist, Psychiatrist or Counsellor, you may be asked to seek their permission before any therapy
sessions can commence.
<br />
Please note that I will be unable to offer my professional services if you suffer from epilepsy or any form
of psychosis.
<br /><br />
<strong>AGE RESTRICTIONS</strong>

<br />
You must be at least 18 years old to participate in online sessions. Clients under the age of 18 years old
must be accompanied by a parent or guardian and will be seen in-person.
<br /><br />
<strong>ATTENDING YOUR SESSIONS</strong>

<br />
Please ensure that you are available at your session start time. If you are running late, please let me
know as soon as possible. I will do my best to make a full session available, however, as the ability to do
this will depend on bookings after your session, this cannot be guaranteed.
<br /><br />
<strong>HYPNOTHERAPY RECORDINGS</strong>

<br />
Hypnotherapy recordings should not be listened to whilst driving, operating machinery or undertaking
any other activity where concentration is required. Any recording provided is for your personal use only
and must not be shared, lent, copied or sold under any circumstances.
<br /><br />
<strong>OUTCOME OF SESSIONS</strong>

<br />
The agreement to work on the issues presented by you in no way implies or guarantees the resolution
of your presenting issue(s). No outcome can or will be guaranteed. However, I will always endeavour to
use my best efforts and skills to work towards your goals and intended outcomes.
<br /><br />
<strong>STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOUR</strong>

<br />
During the course of any therapy sessions, I will treat you with respect and not abuse the trust you
place in me. I will use best practice at all times in our mutual interest. In return, you undertake not to
harm yourself, or any other person, including me, or any property belonging to either me or any other
person.
You agree not to attend sessions under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs, except those
medications which have been prescribed by your doctor. If you do attend any sessions under the
influence of alcohol or recreational drugs, or demonstrate violent or abusive behaviour, I will cancel
the session and may refuse to see you for any further sessions without refunding any payment already
made.
<br /> <br />
<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>

<br />
All contact, including sessions, telephone conversations and emails, will be conducted in confidence
and may be recorded. Prior to any recording, your agreement will be sought. All recordings,
conversations and notes will remain confidential, except in the following circumstances:
1. Where you give permission for confidentiality to be broken
2. Where I am compelled by a court of law
3. Where the information is of a nature that confidentiality cannot be maintained, for example:
• The possibility of harm to yourself or others exists
• In cases of fraud or crime
• When minors (under 18 years old) are involved

available on request.
