      question: "what is hypnosis?",
      answere:"The public perception of hypnosis is one that is concerned with stage shows and mysticism—think Derren Brown, for instance. In the past, recipients of hypnosis have claimed that they felt various changes in their behaviour, thoughts, feelings, and time perception; they might have even hallucinated. While this all may be entertaining to watch, performance hypnosis is nothing like therapeutic hypnosis. In fact, hypnosis is not at all mystical when you strip away the fantastical elements of a magic show. Its effects are oftentimes exaggerated and can seem frightening to people, but it is important to remember that hypnosis has never hurt anyone. It is not mind-control and you cannot get stuck in it. It is a medically approved 1 , legitimate therapy, and has scientifically-backed health benefits.The term hypnosis comes from the Greek word ‘hypnos,’ meaning sleep. However, while sleep is a state of unconsciousness, hypnosis allows you to control and focus your subconsciousness. Unlike many other therapies, it contrives situations in which people respond to imaginative suggestions 2 and can be doubly effective because of this. Hypnosis is a very powerful tool that can be used to boost the effects of psychotherapy and can be used as complementary and/or an alternative to medicinal treatment.1 The American Medical Association approved hypnosis as a therapy in 1958."
