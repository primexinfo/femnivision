      Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Anorexia
nervosa is a condition where people avoid food, severely
restrict food or eat very small quantities of only certain foods.
Eating disorders are serious conditions that cause both physical
and emotional damage. All eating disorders can lead to irreversible
and even life-threatening health problems, such as heart disease,
bone loss, stunted growth, infertility, and kidney damage. Many
people worry about their weight, what they eat, and how they look.

      Love is one of the most profound emotions known to human beings. There
are many kinds of love, but many people seek its expression in a romantic
relationship with a compatible partner (or partners). For these individuals,
romantic relationships comprise one of the most meaningful aspects of life,
and are a source of deep fulfillment. While need for human connection
appears to be innate, the ability to form healthy, loving relationships is
learned. Some evidence suggests that the ability to form a stable relationship
starts to form in infancy, in a child&#39;s earliest experiences with a caregiver who
reliably meets the infant&#39;s needs for food, care, warmth, protection, stimulation,
and social contact.

      The first thing to note is the fact that ‘fear’ and ‘phobia’ are not the
same things. They are two completely different things though they are
similar and interconnected, using them interchangeably is still incorrect.
Fear is a common feeling experienced by everyone. Phobia is a form of
anxiety disorder, which refers to excessive and persistent fear of objects
and situations which do not carry real threats; Specificity. Fear can be felt
by anyone when faced with an unknown or dangerous situation. Phobia
will cause irrational fear that will consume most of most of your time and energy.

      Panic attacks are classified into three basic types: Spontaneous or uncued
panic attacks occur without warning or “out of the blue.” No situational or
environmental triggers are associated with the attack. In any given year,
up to 3 percent of American adults experience panic disorders. Panic disorders
can happen to anyone, and there doesn’t seem to be any particular group that’s
immune to it. Most people first start to experience panic attack symptoms in their
20s, but they can also happen to children.

      Stress is a biological reaction that all of us can experience at any age.

National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) define it as “how the brain
and body respond to any demand.” Stress can be routine, brought on
by sudden negative change or Ttauma experienced during an event
such as an accident, war or a natural disaster. According to Harvard
Health, as we get older, stress can come “as a result of managing chronic
illness, losing a spouse, being a caregiver, or adjusting to changes due to
finances, retirement, or separation from friends and family.” Some people
are able to cope with stress and recover better than others, but long-term
stress can be difficult to manage and it could be harmful to your health.
